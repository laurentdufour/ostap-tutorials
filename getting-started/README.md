# Getting started

The main ingredients of `Ostap` are
 - preconfigured ipython script `ostap`, that can be invoked from the command line.
```bash
ostap
```
{% challenge "Challenge" %}
Invoke the script with `-h` option to get the whole list of all command line options and keys 
{% endchallenge %}
Optionally one can specify the list of python files to be executed before appearance of the interactive command prompt:
```bash
ostap a.py b.py c.py d.py
```
The list of optional arguments can include also root-files, in this case the files will be opened and their handlers will 
be available via local list `root_files`
```bash
ostap a.py b.py c.py d.py file1.root file2.root e.py file3.root 
```
Also `ROOT` macros can be specified on the command line 
```bash
ostap a.py b.py c.py d.py file1.root q1.C file2.root q2.C e.py file3.root q4.C  
```

The script automatically opens `TCanvas` window (unless `--no-canvas` option is specified) 
with (a little bit modified) LHCb style. It also loads necessary decorators for `ROOT` classes. 
At last it executes the python scripts and opens root-files, specified as command line arguments.
