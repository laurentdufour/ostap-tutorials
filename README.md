# The Ostap tutorials [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/ostap-tutorials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/ostap-tutorials)

Ostap is a set of extensions/decorators and utilities over the basic `PyROOT`ï¿¼  functionality (python wrapper for `ROOT` framework). These utilities greatly simplify the interactive manipulations with `ROOT` classes through python.  The main ingredients of `Ostap` are
  - preconfigured ipython script `ostap`, that can be invoked from the command line.
  - _decoration_ of the basic `ROOT` objects, like histograms, graphs etc.
     - operations and operators
     - iteration, element access, etc
     - extended functionality
  - _decoration_ of many basic `ROOT.RooFit` objects
  - set of new useful fit models, components and operations 
  - other useful analysis utilities
