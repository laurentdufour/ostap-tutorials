Also one can provide them in a form of bare RooAbsPdf, but for this case one needs to provide also xvar-variable\nmass  = ROOT.RooRealVar('mass','mass',2,3)\ngauss = ROOT.RooGaussian( 'Gauss', 'Gauss', mass , ... )\nmodel = Fit1D( signal = gauss , xvar = mass , ... )\n\nFor  background components there is also an alternative way to specify it: \n\nNone : RooPolynomial of zero degree (uniform distribution) will be created and used as background component\nAttention: background=None does not imply the absence of background component\n\n\nnegative integer n :  Ostap model PolyPos_pdf will be created and used as background component. This model corresponds to the positive polynomial of  degree -n. The polinomial is constrained to be non-negative for the whole considered interval of xvar.  This constraint allows rather robust and stable fits, especialy  for the low-statistics case. \nnon-negative integer n: Ostap model Bkg_pdf, that  is a product of the exponential function and the positive polynomial of degree n will be created and used as background  component. Note: \nThe background=0 case corresponds to simple exponential backtround \nSince the polynomial is constrained  to be non-negative this PDF is very stable and robust, especually for the low-statistic case,\n\n\nas RooAbsReal object,  in this  case it is interpreted as the exponental slope\n\nAccess to model  componens\nThe indiviaul components can be accessed  using python properties\ngaudd = Gauss_pdf ( ... \nmodel = Fit1D ( signal = gauss , ... ) \nprint model.signal.sigma  ##   get sigma of Gauss \nprint model.signal.mean   ##   get mean  of Gauss\n\nFit parameters\nThe parametters of the created RooAddPdf can be accessed via python properties, \ne.g. for extended fits:\ngaudd = Gauss_pdf ( ... \nmodel = Fit1D ( signal = gauss , ... ) \nprint 'signal yield(s):' , model.S   \nprint 'background(s):'   , model.B\nprint 'others: '         , model.C\nmodel.S = 100   ## set value of signal component to be 100 events \nmodel.B.fix(50) ## fix the yield of the background component at 50  events \nmodel.draw()\n\nDepending on the number of corresponsing componens and flags combine_signals, combine_backgrounds, combine_others these properties can be scalar values or arrays/tuples.\nFor  combine_signal=True, combine_backgrounds =True,  combine_others=True cases oen also gets properrties fS , fB and fC that corresponds to the  fractions of individual signal/backgroud/others components for the compound signal/ signal/backgroud/others.\nFor non-extended fits, the main parameters are fractions:\ngaudd = Gauss_pdf ( ... \nmodel = Fit1D ( signal = gauss , ... , extended = False ) \n...\nprint 'fractions:' , model.F\n\n2D-case\nGeneric 2D-case\nSymmetric 2D-case\n3D-case\nGeneric 3D-case\nSymmetric 3D-case\nMixed-symmetry3D-case\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nostap-tutorials is an open source project,\nand we welcome contributions of all kinds:\n\nNew lessons;\nFixes to existing material;\nBug reports; and\nReviews of proposed changes.\n\nBy contributing,\nyou are agreeing that we may redistribute your work under\nthese licenses.\nYou also agree to abide by our\ncontributor code of conduct.\nGetting Started\n\nWe use the fork and pull model to manage changes.
