The methods,  available from the weight files can be checked as\nprint reader.methods \n`\n\nAnd the usage of the reader is rather trivial, e.g. one can  explicitly request the  responce for certain set of arguments:\nv1,  v2,  v3 = .... \nmlp  = reader['MLP']                     ## get  one method \nprint 'MLP value is %s'  % mlp ( v1 , v2 ,  v3 )\n\nIn practice, one practially always uses it with TTree/TChain/RooAbsData/RooArgSet, in this  case one use 1-argument call,  assuming then proper accessor functions are supplied: \ntree = ... ##  the tree \nmlp  = reader['MLP']                     ## get  one methods \nfor i in tree :                          ## loop over the entries \n    print 'MLP value is %s'  % mlp ( i ) ## get the  value\n\n"},"tools/chopping.html":{"url":"tools/chopping.html","title":"Chopping","keywords":"","body":""},"tools/reweighting.html":{"url":"tools/reweighting.html","title":"Reweighting","keywords":"","body":""},"tools/pidcalib.html":{"url":"tools/pidcalib.html","title":"PidCalib","keywords":"","body":""},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nostap-tutorials is an open source project,\nand we welcome contributions of all kinds:\n\nNew lessons;\nFixes to existing material;\nBug reports; and\nReviews of proposed changes.\n\nBy contributing,\nyou are agreeing that we may redistribute your work under\nthese licenses.\nYou also agree to abide by our\ncontributor code of conduct.\nGetting Started\n\nWe use the fork and pull model to manage changes.
